		conversation
			`As you leave your ship, you see a crowd watching a video on a interactive information display, not far from your landing spot. The video jumps between a panel discussion and footage of Admiral Danforth being quizzed by Parliament. It finishes before you arrive, and many of the onlookers have left for their business, but two captains remain. By the sounds of it, they're having a passionate discussion about the video.`
			choice
				`	"Hey! What's this video about?"`
				`	(Leave them be.)`
					decline
			`	You're startled when the two captains turn to you, twin men with preposterous sideburns and rat-like mustaches. It's impossible to tell if they're smiling or frowning, as the pair live squarely in the middle of the uncanny valley.`
			`	The left twin asks, "Can you believe this? It's been weeks and everyone's still obsessing over the Pug invasion. The news was all experts and officials at first, but now we just see talking heads and conspiracy theorists."`
			`	In disbelief, the right twin responds, "It's just a propaganda exercise to boost Syndicate sales. Even if these elusive 'Pug' existed, we won't hear the end of it as long as the story boosts public opinion of the Syndicate."`
			choice
				`	"It was possibly the biggest event this century. Of course people are going to keep talking about it."`
				`	"Don't you see it was what we needed? The Pug caused us to set aside our pride and resolve our issues directly without continuing the conflict."`
				`	"Oh, the Pug were real alright. I met some and fought them."`
					goto nobody
				`	"I think you both need to shave."`
					goto scowl
			`	One twin rolls his eyes while the other twitches his mustache awkwardly. He rewinds the video to the Parliamentary discussion, where Danforth is reassuring councilors about the Navy's ability to patrol the fringes of human space.`
			`	The left twin says, "Look at this bozo! Bounty's Councilor Maduena Kabiru, he keeps ranting against this Navy guy, uh, this Admiral..." He snaps his fingers trying to remember the name.`
			`	"Admiral Danforth," says the right twin.`
			`	"Right. Danforth. This Councilor wants Danforth to defend against 'unknown dangers at the fringes of human space'. Don't we have enough immediate problems without imagining new horrors?"`
			`	"Like terrorists nuking us," says the right twin.`
			choice
				`	"The Navy is skilled and honorable. I trust them to protect us."`
					goto eyes
				`	"No, don't worry about that. I ended the bomb threat."`
				`	"Maybe you're right."`
					goto shrug
				`	"All we can do is get on with our lives, right?"`
					goto shrug
				`	"If you don't shave soon, people will think you're wearing masks."`
					goto scowl
			label nobody
			`	Both of them give hard belly laughs, sending waves through their mustaches from the breeze of their breath.`
			`	The left twin says, "Who are you, Admiral Danforts?" His twin corrects him. "Danforth. Admiral Danforth. Did the Navy fire you or are you here on holiday?"`
			choice
				`	"Have you been under a rock the whole war? I'm Captain <first> <last>!"`
				`	"Never mind."`
					goto shrug
				`	"At least I don't have a disheveled hamster stuck to my upper lip."`
					goto scowl
			`	Both twins look confused, and the left one responds. "We've been mining asteroids the whole war. The war was a big deal, but most of us had to keep living our lives. Do you think we have time to keep track of every warring captain?"`
			`	The right one says apologetically, "Thank you for your service, Captain <last>."`
			`	They both give clumsy but well-intentioned salutes and return to their ships.`
				decline
			label eyes
			`	The left twin laughs and says, "Pardon us if we keep our eyes open and trust to our own guns." Both twins nod and depart to their ships.`
				decline
			label shrug
			`	Both twins shrug and leave for their ships.`
				decline
			label scowl
			`	Both twins' faces twist in a way that might indicate embarrassment or annoyance. It's hard to tell since their facial hair is halting any emotive power. They walk away in the direction of their ships.`
