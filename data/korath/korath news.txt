			"A local Korath gestures toward a building you've never been inside before. Out of curiosity, you poke your head inside to see the reptilian aliens conversing and sharing drinks: it's a bar. Some things never change, no matter where you are in the galaxy."

			`We gain nothing from a raid when the [donor, gifting] ship is destroyed. Humanika must strive to make better armor.`

			`Of all the [bounty, gifts] we get from your ships, I like ${Korath human delectables} the best.`
			`When I feel guilty about [raiding, harvesting], I think of my starving family, and the guilt suddenly passes.`
			`When our raid [steals, procures] a shipment of ${Korath human bulk food bounty that is perishable} that spoils in transit, we compost it in our aquaponics. Such a shame, though. Humanika food is delicious.`
			`Do I feel guilty for [raiding, harvesting]? No, I feel hungry.`
			`We use heat weapons to overheat your ships instead of destroying them. This increases our [yields, profit margins]. A live Humani will come back with more to [raid, harvest].`

			`The pain from nerve gas is excruciating and we linger for hours [hoping, wishing] to die.`
			`We know Humanika history. You make the same mistakes over and over, but you overcome the [hardships, obstacles] you create for yourself. Korath are not obstacles. We are just hungry. I wish there was a better way than [raiding, harvesting] your ships.`
