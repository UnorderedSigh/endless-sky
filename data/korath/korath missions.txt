			`	The one in front turns back to where it came from, and the Korath behind you hisses and gestures forward. It looks like you should follow. You brace yourself and turn the corner to see... animals?`
			`	The rusting buildings have given way to a massive abandoned plaza, and the entire space is taken up by a mix of large livestock and supplies. They remind you of sheep, but they're around five times larger, have six legs, and come in a variety of brown-black colors. Each has a full coat of fur and an additional blanket made of their own wool-like fabric on them. It's the same material these Korath are wearing. Even with their extra blanket, the "sheep" are huddled in small groups and look uncomfortably cold. They occasionally bleat loudly whenever a cold wind rushes through the plaza. Fortunately for you, these Kor Efreti look to be farmers, not muggers. This must have been the only place near the spaceport where they could keep their entire herd together.`
			`	The one who led you here, who also seems to be the leader, gestures for you to come over to it. It has opened a paper map - a rare sight in the era of interstellar travel. When you take a look, you realize it's not of the local area, but space; it seems to show the surroundings systems. The Korath points to one, pauses and gestures broadly at the mix of livestock and supplies, then draws its finger to another system and says something that sounds roughly like <planet>. "<planet>?" you confirm, and the Korath hisses in approval. It looks like they want transportation there. You wager the livestock and supplies will take up roughly <tons>, and there are <bunks> Korath farmers in the group.`
			`	It pulls a stack of 200 credits from its pocket and sets it on the ground before drawing a circle around it with a piece of chalk. It then draws four more, makes a large circle around the five total smaller ones, then draws nine additional large circles. Your best guess is it's offering 10,000 credits for their transport.`

When you arrive, it immediately goes to work spreading tarps over the floor and scattering a type of straw over them. After some time, you notice one of the "sheep" emerge from an alleyway led by a farmer that had stayed behind. Behind it is another animal, then another. The line of livestock, interspersed with the farmers keeping things moving, slowly makes it way into your hangar over the next hour.`
			`	As they enter your climate-controlled ship, the farmers take the hefty, wool-like blankets off the "sheep" and remove most of their own layers. One takes the entire pile of fabric to a nearby vendor and exchanges it for credits while the others go back and grab the supplies still in the plaza. By nightfall, everything and everyone is finally loaded onto your ship. The Korath who had sold the clothes to the merchant gives you the entire stack of 4,100 credits.

Based on how often they're in and out of the bathroom during the one-jump trip, none of them have been in hyperspace before. When they get over their space sickness, they busy themselves shaving the wool-like fur off the animals and gathering it.`
			`	As you land and open the cargo doors to reveal the hot world of <planet>, the animals shift excitedly. They seem much more energetic than any time before now, so much so that the Korath have some trouble keeping them all together as they exit the ship. The slow desertification of this planet is surely a cause for concern, but it seems to provide a much healthier environment for these animals than Setar Fort's chilling temperatures do. Once everything is off your ship, a Korath takes the wool to another vendor and again sells it, then it returns and hands you 5,900 credits. With the 4,100 credits it gave you before leaving, you've received all 10,000 promised credits. It holds its hands up with its palms toward you then leaves to join the other farmers.`

Their technology is far beyond ours, and they used it to nearly wipe themselves out in bloody infighting. We learned a lot from them: even the most aggressive Unfettered are wary of attacking Hai planets, lest our species destroy itself like the Korath did. In all our raids in the Wah Ki system, never once have the Unfettered targeted civilian areas on Cloudfire." Batu appears shocked by this.`

It seems the Korath have been raiding ships in pirate and Syndicate systems for food, while the pirates have been pillaging Korath ships for tech.

			`	Batu nods and pulls up something on his datapad. He reads mechanically to you. "The drone fleet acts as a phase array transceiver and hyperwave sounder. A phase array uses signals from multiple sources (the drones) transmitting or receiving slightly out of phase, to emulate a much larger antenna. It's the same principle as phase array radars used for meteorology and phase array telescopes for astronomy. Each drone's communication system is not much stronger than a human hyperspace relay, but the fleet acts together as one powerful relay. We think it's able to relay signals as far as 120 light-years, without the need for starlanes. What's most concerning is that relaying is only a secondary functionality; they're mostly observation systems.`
			`	He slides his finger across the pad and continues. "They were hard to detect, and have probably been hiding for years, perhaps decades. From debris analysis, we determined the drones are painted with a material that tricks human sensors, so seeing them is tough. Their transmissions are cleverly disguised as ambient noise, so you can't listen for them either. However, we've developed computer algorithms that'll let you find them. Essentially, your computer finds where they aren't, and works inward from there." He looks up from his datapad at last.`
